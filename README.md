# Cardano Smart Contracts Tutorial

Welcome to the Cardano Smart Contracts Tutorial repository!  
Here, you will find a series of Jupyter notebooks that explain how to write, test, and deploy smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

## What you will find in this repository

- Explanations and examples of how to write smart contracts using Marlowe and Blockly.
- Steps for testing and building your contract ideas using Marlowe.
- Instructions for deploying your contracts using the `marlowe-cli` and Python code.
- Explanations of the `marlowe-cli` commands and how they can be used to simulate contract execution on a testnet chain.
- Images created in Miro to help visualize transactions and explain the contract idea.
- Pandas code to keep track of transaction data in a tabular form.
- A list of resources used as reference throughout the tutorial.

## reading the notebooks

You can run the code and see for yourself how this works.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand this repository with more notebooks covering different use cases and experiments.
